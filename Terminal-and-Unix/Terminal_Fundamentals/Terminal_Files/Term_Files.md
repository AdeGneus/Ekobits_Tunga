# Terminal Files Exercise

## Question 2

- The `mv` command creates the destination file/folder we are moving into, then it copies the content of the source file/folder into the destination file/folder, afterwards it deletes the source file/folder. It partly does the work of the `cp` command.

## Question 10

- The `-r` flag is an option that allows the `cp` command to recursively go through the files/folder before copying.
